This is a terminal text-based game written in python.
In its nature, the game represents a lot of functions with delayed printing side effets. 
This is my first ever program and it is more verbose than it is functional.

I plan on adding more functionality to the game. For instance, the ability to take health damage and having more interactions with characters within the game.

The game cannot be paused and resumed. I want to add this logic as well.
